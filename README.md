# üöÄ Features

## Check Colors

![color check](./assets/color-check.gif)

**What?** Checks all the colours in the selected frame that aren't using the intended functional colors defined from our design library.

**Why?** Because it's okay to design quickly with the color picker (we're all guity of this, don't lie). But this tool should help us clean up the mess afterwards.

## Convert to Dark / Light Theme

![theme swap](./assets/theme-swap.gif)

**What?** One click function to convert the entire frame to Dark / Light theme function colours

**Why?** Because doing it one by one under the native Figma "Selection Color" is laborious.

## Auto Layout Spacings

![auto layout spacing](./assets/spacing.gif)

Adjust auto layout spacings with spacing defined from our tokens. Visible when you have a Frame with Auto Layout enabled selected.

**What?** A shortcut for applying spacing values in the Auto Layout properties.

**Why?** Gets us thinking in sizes (ie. S, M, L ) instead of pixel values (ie. 16px, 24px, 32px)

**Note** There‚Äôs a weird Figma glitch: After you change a slider value, your cursor needs to go back to Figma canvas to update the frame to the most up to date value. Not sure why, it‚Äôs a weird Figma plugin issue I couldn‚Äôt fix.

# üí¨ To Contribute

If you want to contribute, run this plugin locally on your machine and watch for code changes.

1. `npm install` to install all the dependencies
2. `npx webpack` to watch the `./src` folder and compile any code changes.
3. To see the changes after each compile, bring the Figma desktop app to the foreground, and use `command + option + p` shortcut which tells Figma to re-run the last plugin.
